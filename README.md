# Poker Hand Scorer

This project focuses on applying OO design principles and TDD.

Users will be prompted to enter a text representation of a 5 card poker hand and 
the program will score the hand based the the set of cards entered. 

This project uses RSpec for unit testing.

Start the game by running  `ruby lib/start_hand_scorer.rb`
